 * UnderwritingRule2 - This verification is an individual and entity screening service designed in coordination with the U.S. Department of Treasury. The search returns exact matches, as well as partial matches which meet a minimum threshold as defined by the user. The higher the threshold, the fewer results will be returned and the higher the likelihood of a match. For Example, if the minScore is set to a threshold of 50, it is likely to return more results than one could reasonably analyze.
